    <h3>Setup:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pair off into teams of two</li>
        <li>Teams must sit with an even amount of opponents between them</li>
        <li>Begin shuffling the decks of cards.</li>
        <li>Once all the decks have been thoroughly shuffled. Hand them all to the dealer.</li>
        <li>Dealer, you will start distributing the cards, one by one, face down, starting with the person to your left.</li>
        <li>Dealer, once each player has received 10 cards stop.</li>
        <li>All players collect their 10 card pile. This is called your "Hand".</li>
        <li>Dealer, you will begin distributing cards again, as you did before, but this time you will stop at 5 cards.</li>
        <li>Once all players have received their second set of cards, called your "Foot", they will set them aside (DO NOT LOOK AT THE CARDS!). </li>
        <li>Now that the "Hand" and "Foot" have been delt, place the remaining cards in the center of the table.</li>
        <li> Dealer will flip over the top card of the left over cards, and place it near the pile. This will be the first card in the "Trash" pile.</li>
        <li>Allow time for all players to organize the cards the way they want.</li>
        <li>The player imediatly to the left of the Dealer is the first player to play.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Before we begin playing, lets first cover the point value of each card.</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Cards 4-9 are worth 5pts each.</li>
        <li>Cards 10-K are worth 10pts each.</li>
        <li>Aces are worth 20pts each.</li>
        <li>2's are wild and worth 20pts each.</li>
        <li>Jokers are wild and worth 50pts each.</li>
        <li>Black 3's are worth Zero points each.</li>
        <li>Red 3's are always worth -150 points.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Game Play!</h3>
    <p>First you must know your goal. To win of course! But how, is the catch. 
        You and your teammate must accumulate the most points. To accumulate points, you need to have cards
        laid down on the table. In order for cards to be placed on the table, they must be placed in stacks
        of like cards. For example all the 4s would be together, all the J's would be together. To start a stack,
        You must have three or more of that card (A wild can replace ONE of the initail cards). You can only
        have one wild per stack, and once a wild is played it cannot be moved to another stack or used again.
        combination examples would could be three Ks or two Ks and one wild (a Joker or a 2). Once you and your
        teammate have placed cards down on the table, you will work to get rid of all the cards in your "Hand."
        Once all the cards in your hand have been used or discarded, you may look at your "Foot." Once you
        are on your "Foot" you goal is to use all those cards. Once any player has used all the cards in their "Foot."
        The round has ended. At the end of the round, all cards still in any players "Hand" or "Foot" are worth negative points.
        Red 3s are always worth -150pts. Each team then tallys their points and jots it down on the score tracking sheet.
        A new round is delt, and the game continues. The game should be played until one team reaches a certain number of points (typically its about 2000pts).
        At that point the game is over and the team who reach the points first, or the team with the most points wins.</p>
    <h3>Now we will walk through a player's turn.</h3>
        <ul>
        <h4>Each turn, the player must start by picking up a card. They do so, through two options.</h4>
        <li>They can chose to take one card from the top of the facedown pile of cards in the center of the playing area.</li>
        <li>Or the player can take entire pile of "Trash" cards.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h4>The player now has a few options.</h4>
        <li>If they have accumulated 90pts between the sets of cards they are holding, they can
            place those sets on the table in front of them.</li>
        <li>Or if their teammate has already laid down, the player can add any available cards to 
            their teammates stacks. (only placing like cards in like piles)
        </li>
        <li>For the player to end their turn, they must throw away one card to the "Trash" pile.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <h4>Additional informatoin.</h4>
        <li>To keep the game flowing, if a player picks up the "Trash" pile and it is large, they may imediately
             throw away a card to allow other to continue while they sort and perform their tasks. Additionally, 
             if your teammate picked up a large "Trash" pile, it is in your best interest to wait if they are not
              finished by the time it is your turn.
        </li>
        <li>If a player uses all of the cards in their "Hand" without throwing away a card, they may continue
            their turn with the cards in their "Foot".
        </li>
        <li>Some communication is allowed between teams, but no specific details are to be shared. 
            General comments like "I am just short of the needed 90pts" or "I just need one more card, and I can get to my 'Foot'".
        </li>
        <li>As a reminder, you are only permited to discard one card each turn. If you have accumulated three red 3s.
            It would take you three turns to discard all of them.
        </li>
    </ul>
